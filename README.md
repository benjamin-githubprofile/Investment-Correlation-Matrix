# Project README

This README provides an overview of the files included in the project.

## File Descriptions

1. `parse.cpp`
   - Description: This file likely contains the implementation of parsing functionalities. It could include functions for reading, interpreting, and processing data inputs.

2. `asset.hpp`
   - Description: This header file likely declares the structure and functions related to assets used in the project. It may include class definitions, constants, and function prototypes.

3. `main.cpp`
   - Description: The main driver of the application. This file probably contains the `main` function and serves as the entry point of the program. It may initialize necessary components and start the program execution.

4. `Makefile`
   - Description: Used for automating the build process. This file contains commands for compiling the source code and generating the executable, managing dependencies, and possibly other build-related tasks.

5. `asset.cpp`
   - Description: The implementation file for `asset.hpp`. It likely includes the definitions of the functions and classes declared in the `asset.hpp` file. It is responsible for the functionality related to assets.

## General Information

- The project is structured in a way that separates the implementation (.cpp files) from the declarations (.hpp files). 
- The `Makefile` provides a convenient way to compile the project with predefined commands.
- The main logic of the application resides in `main.cpp`, which calls upon functionalities defined in other files.

For more detailed information, refer to the comments and documentation within each file.
